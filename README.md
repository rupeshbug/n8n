### 1. Lead Capture & Notification (Form â†’ Google Sheets + Email)
**Description:** Automates lead management by capturing form submissions, saving them into Google Sheets as a centralized database, and instantly sending an email alert with the leadâ€™s details. This ensures no potential lead is missed and the team can follow up quickly.

### 2. Real Estate Client Automation with AI (Google Sheets + API + OpenAI â†’ Dynamic Email)
**Description:** Enhances client onboarding for real estate using both API enrichment and AI-powered communication. When new client data (ID, Name, Number, Budget) is submitted:  
1. Gender is predicted using **Genderize.io**.  
2. Nationality is predicted using **Nationalize.io**.  
3. Both predictions are appended to Google Sheets alongside the client data.  
4. The full client details are passed into an **OpenAI model**, which generates a well-structured and professional email template.  
5. The dynamically crafted email is sent to notify the team about the new client.
