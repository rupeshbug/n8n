# n8n Automations ðŸš€

This repository contains a collection of automation workflows built with [n8n](https://n8n.io/).  
Each project solves a real-world problem like connecting APIs, saving form data, or sending notifications.

### 1. Lead Capture & Notification (Form â†’ Google Sheets + Email)
- **Description:** Automates lead management by capturing form submissions, saving them into Google Sheets as a centralized database, and instantly sending an email alert with the leadâ€™s details. This ensures no potential lead is missed and the team can follow up quickly.
